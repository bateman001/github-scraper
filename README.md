## Description

Welcome to GitHub Scraper. GitHub Scraper pulls user data and repo data from the GitHub API then stores it in an SQLite database. This project was meant to be used from __both__ Postman/Browser and the command line on your local machine. I will provide descriptions of the endpoints and command line prompts below.

*if not cloning from github start at step 2*

2. `cd` into repository
3. Make a fresh start of the git history for this project with `rm -rf .git && git init`
4. Copy the AUTH_TOKEN I sent you, or create your own GitHub API token and paste it inbetween the the double quotes on line 8 of setup.sh
